Use compounding

> Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. **Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation.**

Compounding in business

> Few businesses in the world have true **network effects and extreme scalability**. But **with technology**, more and more will.

Compounding in career

> It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—**most careers progress fairly linearly**.

How does compounding in career works

> As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as **capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people**.

Train your judgement with consistently delivering results

> As you get more data points that your judgment is good and **you can consistently deliver results**, trust yourself more.

Managing morale

> Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale—is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavours. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief.

Self-belief with self-awareness to avoid self-delusion

> Self-belief must be balanced with self- awareness... **Truth-seeking is hard and often painful**, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.

Sales == Evangelising

> All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to **evangelise your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors**, etc.

Communication = written + spoken

> Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making. My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your **thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language**.

High risks earlier, low bets often

> It’s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don’t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain. Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. **Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works.** Then make a bigger bet in that direction.

Keeping life simple, flexible and frugal

> But when you aren’t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on things that might turn out to be really interesting. **Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this**, but obviously comes with tradeoffs.

Focus to work on the right things

> Focus is a force multiplier on work. Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well- served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more **important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours**.

Small number of priorities

> Once you have figured out what to do, **be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly**.

Use momentum, success begets success

> As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success.

Work hard consistently, sustainably

> You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is to **find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with**.

Work on hard problems

> I believe that it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters.

Work on problems that are important and you really want!

> If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and **don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on**.

Curiosity

> Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.

Persistence for long enough for luck to work

> They are **persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck** to go their way.

Success and optimism goes hand in hand

> To be wilful, you have to be optimistic— hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.

Getting good at things difficult to copy: intersection and personal brand

>  **If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money.** The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields.

Genuinely help others!

> An effective way to **build a network is to help people** as much as you can. Doing this, over a long period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my four best investments.

Spotting talent, especially undiscovered ones

> A particularly valuable part of building a network is to **get good at discovering undiscovered talent**. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice.

People do not get rich from salaries

> The biggest economic misunderstanding of my childhood was that people got rich from high salaries.

Owning business, real estate, natural resources, IP

> You get truly **rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value**. This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things. But somehow or other, **you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time**. Time only scales linearly.

Impressing people is external motivation

> Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people.

Working on consensus ideas is externally driven

> First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks. You will care a lot— much more than you realise — if other people think you’re doing the right thing. **This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work**, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway.

Success and internal motivation

> The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world.

Define success by performing excellent work

> Eventually, you will **define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you**. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t **obsessed with**.
