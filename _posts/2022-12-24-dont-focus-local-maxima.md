Definition

> A **local maximum** is the greatest possible value in a given area while the **global maximum** is the actual greatest possible value

Unnecessary competition == suboptimal outcomes

> We overvalue local maxima, and that overvaluation **creates unnecessarily steep competition** on very narrow planes and **sub-optimal outcomes for everyone involved**.

Availability Bias

> It’s the “ Availability Heuristic ” at work: **we think most about the things that we’re more familiar with and that we see most commonly**.

End-all-be-all mentality

> Instead of just treating the school’s (usually meager) recruiting **resources as one of many sources** of jobs, **we treat it as the end-all-be-all and compete fiercely against our peers over the few options available there**. Instead of expanding our radius to areas with less competition, we choose to wait in line.

## Examples

Typical schooling example

> Or if you were to say “I want to learn as much as possible about design” but *only look at what classes you can take at a college*, you would be **neglecting numerous other methods of learning** and would be **limited by your unintentional constraint**.

Examples in school and career

> Students will focus on the companies that come to their schools or post on their recruiting platforms. Professionals will look at companies that are one “stepping stone” up the ladder in their industry.

Typical examples in school to make yourself stand out as a college student:

- Having a high GPA
- Leading student organizations
- Being on student government
- Being on Dean’s list
- Playing sports
- Hosting campus events
- Taking “hard classes”
- Internships

## Solution

Expand the radius

> When we don’t expand our radius of what we can compete on, **we focus on the lowest common denominators** (nearest restaurants), **instead of going for the actual biggest and best opportunities**.

External opportunities

> With job hunting, that means **look for opportunities beyond what’s offered** at your school. Maybe even make an effort to not use your school’s resources since that’s where your competition is highest.

What is the intention? The usual way, and find a better way!

> The common thread here is stand out. Don’t just be “different” since different isn’t necessarily good, but **figure out what the goal is** (get a job, start a successful company, build a massive readership, become a best seller, develop a brand, etc.), look at how everyone else is doing it (the likely local maxima) and **then find a better way**.

The result: higher upside + less stress

> It requires a bit more creativity, and maybe a bit more risk, but when you hit on it, you’re in an **open playing field with higher upside, less stress, and an opportunity to truly distinguish yourself**.
