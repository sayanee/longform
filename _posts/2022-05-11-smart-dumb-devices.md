Meaning of unconnected device

> Dumb devices (think sensors and actuators) were pretty easily defined as something that just **did a simple task like reading temperature or sensing vibration** and then, every now and then, **reporting that information back** to some kind of control system.

Meaning of connected device

> Smart devices could perhaps save some data, **run some computations on it, and create an alert based on some threshold** or other that was reached.

Ecosystem of connected devices

> In fact, as time goes on, the whole idea of an internet of individual "things" really won't have much meaning. It's a **continuum, with low-capability, minimally-connected devices on one end and highly-capable, multilaterally-connected devices** on the other.

Meaning of connected device

> Ultimately, what makes a device "smart" isn't the onboard compute and storage capabilities of the device itself **but what it can do when it is connected to other devices and then to processing platforms that can act on that information**.

Connectivity and platforms to do something useful

> That's why trying to pigeonhole IoT as smart or dumb today kind of misses the point. It's the **connectivity and the platforms that tie all these devices together** that give the future of IoT its power.
