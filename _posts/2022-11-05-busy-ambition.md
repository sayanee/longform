Busy vs Simple Ambition

> instead of embracing a **haphazard collection of overlapping projects**, Grisham instead built a **simplified routine centered on the singular goal** of producing one book per year.

Type 1

> It craves activity and feasts at the buffet of appealing opportunities that success creates.

Type 2

> It craves simplicity and autonomy, and sees success as a source of leverage to reduce stressful obligations.
