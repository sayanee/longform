Active learning

> Active learning is when you’re **concentrated — focusing all your attention** on the task at hand. But this alone is not enough. Active, concentrated thinking on a topic is great — but **you can’t sustainably do it forever**.

Diffuse learning

> So after a hard study session, take a break, take a walk, even take a quick nap, and know that your brain is still making valuable connections as you rest. The catch? You need to actually relax your mind, so doom scrolling on your phone doesn’t count.

Pairing

> When you pair with someone less experienced than you, you can reinforce your own knowledge by explaining it to others
