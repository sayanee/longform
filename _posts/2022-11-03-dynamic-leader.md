Range of tools at Etsy that help move our people forward:

1. Stretch assignments - Specifically giving someone a challenge that is outside the expectations of their current role or level
1. Rotations with another team - Working with another team can provide new perspectives and encourage people to network more widely.
1. Training - Though it seems obvious, training is easy to overlook, and opportunities for training change frequently.
1. Mentorship opportunities - Giving someone the chance to mentor more junior personnel encourages growth in empathy and other non-technical skills.

The various styles that you will need to employ:

- Directing : this is an appropriate style when someone is learning something for the first time and involves you as the leader providing explicit guidance.
- Coaching : if someone is very motivated to learn in a given area but still needs some extra guidance, this is a good style to use and involves bringing them into the process a bit more.
- Supporting : if the person has the skills and tools needed to complete the task but may lack the confidence to complete it, you may want to consider this mode and lean into supportive behaviors.
- Delegation : finally, if they have both the skill, motivation and confidence to handle the challenge, then delegation is more appropriate.

Feedback

> Shortening feedback loops is critical when leading someone that is growing in an area that is new to them
