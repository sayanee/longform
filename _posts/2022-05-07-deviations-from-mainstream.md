Empowered to do something different and specific

> The waiter in the first anecdote had to overhear the conversation between father and daughter, understand the dynamics at the table, and then had to be **empowered to gift them the free bottle of wine**. The wait staff in the second anecdote had to rely on an understanding of the customer across restaurants in the same F&B group. **Neither were accidental.**

What HR practices creates such a system?

> a synergistic set of human resource management practices involving three key practices: **selection of employees based on emotional capabilities, respectful treatment of employees, and management through a simple set of rules** that stimulate complex and intricate behaviours benefiting customers

Simulation of scenarios

> There, they simulated difficult situations that managers would have to deal with on a day-to-day basis:

- how to reprimand an employee who kept making mistakes
- how to pre-emptively notice a customer growing frustrated
- how to mediate the inevitable disputes between front-of-house staff and back-of-house kitchen crew

> Formalising Danny’s intuitive practices helped USH scale their operations to an empire of incredibly successful restaurants.

Incentive-motivated behaviours

> To reiterate: **whenever you find behaviour that deviates from a set of mainstream incentive-motivated behaviours, you should probably take a closer look**. In this case, what you’ll find is a set of interlocking systems that together creates a rather different set of incentives — a set of incentives that, if Meyer would have you believe it — resulted in a remarkable restaurant business.

How to train unskilled labour for scaling businesses

> I had caught my old boss’s implied point about the training SOPs immediately — it meant that these businesses had found a solution for the F&B labour problem, by **standardising around dead simple playbooks**, tuned for unskilled labour.
