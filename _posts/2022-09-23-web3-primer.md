Web3 defitinion

> Web3 is a set of emerging **tools and technologies for building decentralized, distributed applications**. This includes tools for file storage, data storage, name resolution, identity, compute, and even code hosting

Current state of web3

> Right now what we call web3 is mostly centered on public blockchains like Ethereum

Example of decentralised storage

> decentralized file storage solutions like IPFS and Arweave , and decentralized data storage tools like Ceramic and OrbitDB .

Example of app layer for web3

> emerging app layer for web3, which would be something like ENS for name resolution, protocols like Ceramic

Example of identity layer for web3

> I would also add to this toolkit ZK tools , or zero-knowledge tools, which use cryptography in interesting ways that preserve user privacy.

Attributes:

- Permissionless . Anyone on the network can call the functions that you have exposed on your contracts at any time.
- Immutable . Once you've deployed a contract, you can't change it.
- Costly . The Ether asset is required to pay for storage and computation.
- Deterministic . This means that we can know, based on state at time zero, what the following state at time one is going to
- Adversarial . This one combines all the previous properties in some ways, because the value you store in a smart contract is its own sort of bug bounty.

Why should you learn about web3?

> Even if you donâ€™t want to become a smart contract programming expert, spending a little time with Solidity in this interesting paradigm is a great way to stretch yourself and become a better programmer.
