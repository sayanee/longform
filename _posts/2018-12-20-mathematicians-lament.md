## Music as a case study

A musician's nightmare

> “We are helping our students **become more competitive in an increasingly sound-filled world**.” Educators, school systems, and the state are put in charge of this vital project. Studies are commissioned, committees are formed, and decisions are made — all **without the advice or participation of a single working musician or composer**.

If music was a compulsory school subject like maths

> Students must take **courses in Scales and Modes, Meter, Harmony, and Counterpoint**. “It’s a lot for them to learn, but **later in college when they finally get to hear all this stuff, they’ll really appreciate** all the work they did in high school.” Of course, not many students actually go on to concentrate in music, so only a few will ever get to hear the sounds that the black dots represent. Nevertheless, it is important that every member of society be able to recognize a modulation or a fugal passage, **regardless of the fact that they will never hear one**.

Learning music without any music

> I was surprised to find myself in a regular school classroom — **no easels, no tubes of paint**. “Oh we don’t actually apply paint until high school,” I was told by the students. “In seventh grade we mostly study colors and applicators.” They **showed me a worksheet**. On one side were swatches of color with blank spaces next to them.

Learning music for foundation

> The really excellent painters— the ones who know their colors and brushes backwards and forwards— they get to the actual painting a little sooner, and some of them even take the Advanced Placement classes for college credit. But mostly we’re just trying to give these kids a good foundation in what painting is all about, **so when they get out there in the real world and paint their kitchen they don’t make a total mess of it**.”

The actual painting... when?

> “I see. And when do students get to paint freely, on a blank canvas?” “You sound like one of my professors! They were **always going on about expressing yourself and your feelings** and things like that—really way-out-there abstract stuff. I’ve got a **degree in Painting myself**, but **I’ve never really worked much with blank canvasses**.

Students who know what is really going on

> The only people who understand what is going on are the ones most **often blamed and least often heard**: the students. They say, “math class is **stupid and boring**,” and **they are right**.

## Maths and culture

Maths is an art!

> The first thing to understand is that **mathematics is an art**. The difference between math and the other arts, such as music and painting, is that our culture does not recognize it as such. Everyone understands that poets, painters, and musicians create works of art, and are **expressing themselves in word, image, and sound**.

Art is beautiful and imaginary

> If there is anything like a unifying aesthetic principle in mathematics, it is this: **simple is beautiful**. Mathematicians enjoy thinking about the simplest possible things, and the simplest possible things are imaginary.

No practical purpose

> There’s no ulterior practical purpose here. I’m just playing. That’s what math is — **wondering, playing, amusing yourself with your imagination**. For one thing, the question of how much of the box the triangle takes up doesn’t even make any sense for real, physical objects. Even the most carefully made physical triangle is still a hopelessly complicated collection of jiggling atoms; it changes its size from one minute to the next. That is, unless you want to talk about **some sort of approximate measurements**. Well, that’s where the aesthetic comes in.

Why is the area of a triangle half of its base times height?

> If I chop the rectangle into two pieces like this, I can see that each piece is cut diagonally in half by the sides of the triangle. So **there is just as much space inside the triangle as outside**. That means that the triangle must take up exactly half the box! This is what a piece of mathematics looks and feels like. That **little narrative is an example of the mathematician’s art**: asking simple and elegant questions about our imaginary creations, and crafting satisfying and beautiful explanations.

Memorizing formulae

> Students are **asked to memorize this formula and then “apply” it over** and over in the “exercises.” Gone is the thrill, the joy, even the pain and frustration of the creative act. There is not even a problem anymore. The **question has been asked and answered at the same time** — there is nothing left for the student to do.

No creative discovery

> By **removing the creative process** and leaving only the results of that process, you virtually guarantee that no one will have any real engagement with the subject. It is like saying that Michelangelo created a beautiful sculpture, without letting me see it. How am I supposed to be inspired by that? ... By **concentrating on what, and leaving out why**, mathematics is reduced to an empty shell. The **art is not in the “truth” but in the explanation, the argument**. It is the argument itself which gives the truth its context, and determines what is really being said and meant. Mathematics is the **art of explanation**.

Creation of the wrong culture

> The cultural problem is a self-perpetuating monster: students learn about math from their teachers, and teachers learn about it from their teachers, so this **lack of understanding and appreciation for mathematics in our culture replicates itself indefinitely**. Worse, the perpetuation of this “pseudo-mathematics,” this emphasis on the accurate yet **mindless manipulation of symbols**, creates its own culture and its own set of values.

Good at following directions

> Many a graduate student has come to grief when they discover, after a decade of being told they were “good at math,” that **in fact they have no real mathematical talent and are just very good at following directions**. Math is not about following directions, it’s about **making new directions**.

Maths and its importance!

> It would be bad enough if the culture were merely ignorant of mathematics, but what is far worse is that people actually think they do know what math is about— and are apparently under the **gross misconception that mathematics is somehow useful to society**! This is already a huge difference between mathematics and the other arts. Mathematics is viewed by the culture as some sort of tool for science and technology. Everyone knows that poetry and music are for **pure enjoyment and for uplifting and ennobling the human spirit** (hence their virtual elimination from the public school curriculum) but no, math is important.

Practicality does not serve its purpose

> I’m merely suggesting that **just because something happens to have practical consequences, doesn’t mean that’s what it is about**. Music can lead armies into battle, but that’s not why people write symphonies. Michelangelo decorated a ceiling, but I’m sure he had loftier things on his mind.

Usefulness is a by-product

>  Mathematics should be taught as art for art’s sake. These mundane “useful” aspects would follow naturally as a **trivial by-product**. Beethoven could easily write an advertising jingle, but his motivation for learning music was to create something beautiful.

But learning something useful!

> Simplicio: But don’t you think that if math class were made more like art class that a lot of kids just wouldn’t learn anything? Salviati: **They’re not learning anything now!** Better to not have math classes at all than to do what is currently being done.

## Mathematics in School

Mandatory

> There is surely **no more reliable way to kill enthusiasm and interest in a subject** than to make it a mandatory part of the school curriculum. Include it as a **major component of standardized testing** and you virtually guarantee that the education establishment will suck the life out of it.

What is Maths??

> All this fussing and primping about which “topics” should be taught in what order, or the **use of this notation instead of that notation**, or which make and model of calculator to use, for god’s sake— it’s like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic! Mathematics is the **music of reason**. To do mathematics is to **engage in an act of discovery and conjecture, intuition and inspiration**; to be in a state of confusion — not because it makes no sense to you, but because you gave it sense and you still don’t understand what your creation is up to; **to have a breakthrough idea; to be frustrated as an artist**; to be awed and overwhelmed by an almost painful beauty; to be alive, damn it.

Practical or fantasy?

> In any case, do you really think kids even want something that is relevant to their daily lives? **You think something practical like compound interest is going to get them excited?** People enjoy fantasy, and that is just what mathematics can provide— a relief from daily life, an anodyne to the practical workaday world.

History of its discovery

> But what about the real story? The one about **mankind’s struggle with the problem of measuring curves**; about Eudoxus and Archimedes and the method of exhaustion; about the transcendence of pi? Which is more interesting— measuring the rough dimensions of a circular piece of graph paper, using a formula that someone handed you without explanation (and made you memorize and practice over and over) or **hearing the story of one of the most beautiful, fascinating problems, and one of the most brilliant and powerful ideas in human history**?

What is a good problem?

> A good problem is **something you don’t know how to solve**. That’s what makes it a good puzzle, and a good opportunity. A good problem **does not just sit there in isolation**, but serves as a springboard to **other interesting questions**. A triangle takes up half its box. What about a pyramid inside its three-dimensional box? Can we handle this problem in a similar way?

Struggle and frustration

> I can understand the idea of training students to master certain techniques— I do that too. But not as an end in itself. **Technique in mathematics, as in any art, should be learned in context.** The great problems, their history, the creative process— that is the proper setting. Give your students a good problem, **let them struggle and get frustrated**. See what they come up with. **Wait until they are dying for an idea, then give them some technique. But not too much.**

How to teach Maths?

> So how do we teach our students to do mathematics? By **choosing engaging and natural problems suitable to their tastes, personalities, and level of experience**. By giving them **time to make discoveries and formulate conjectures**. By helping them to refine their arguments and creating an atmosphere of healthy and vibrant mathematical criticism. By being flexible and open to sudden changes in direction to which their curiosity may lead. In short, by having an honest intellectual relationship with our students and our subject.

A Maths teacher

> Why is it that we accept math teachers who have never produced an original piece of mathematics, **know nothing of the history and philosophy of the subject**, nothing about recent developments, nothing in fact beyond what they are expected to present to their unfortunate students? What kind of a teacher is that? How can someone teach something that they themselves don’t do? I can’t dance, and consequently I would never presume to think that I could teach a dance class (I could try, but it wouldn’t be pretty). The difference is I know I can’t dance.

Modern teaching

> In particular, you can’t teach teaching. Schools of education are a complete crock. Oh, you can take classes in early childhood development and whatnot, and **you can be trained to use a blackboard “effectively” and to prepare an organized “lesson plan”** (which, by the way, insures that your lesson will be planned, and therefore false), but you will never be a real teacher if you are unwilling to be a real person. Teaching means **openness and honesty, an ability to share excitement, and a love of learning**.

How should we teach Maths then?

> **Play games!** Teach them Chess and Go, Hex and Backgammon, Sprouts and Nim, whatever. Make up a game. **Do puzzles.** Expose them to situations where **deductive reasoning** is necessary.

Real learning

> But the fact is, people learn better **when the product comes out of the process**. A real appreciation for poetry does not come from memorizing a bunch of poems, it **comes from writing your own**.

How is mathematics done?

> Most mathematics is done with a friend over a cup of coffee, with a diagram scribbled on a napkin. **Mathematics is and always has been about ideas, and a valuable idea transcends the symbols** with which you choose to represent it. As Gauss once remarked, “What we need are notions, not notations.”

Mental acuity

>  If anything, the current system has the opposite effect of dulling the mind. Mental acuity of any kind comes from **solving problems yourself, not from being told how to solve them**.

Trained Mathematician?

> How many students taking literature classes will one day be writers? That is not why we teach literature, nor why students take it. **We teach to enlighten everyone**, not to train only the future professionals. In any case, the most valuable skill for a scientist or engineer is being able to **think creatively and independently**. The last thing anyone needs is to be trained.

The Ladder Myth

> This is intimately connected to what I call the “ladder myth”— the idea that mathematics can be arranged as **a sequence of “subjects” each being in some way more advanced**, or “higher” than the previous. The effect is to make school mathematics into a race— some students are “ahead” of others, and parents worry that their child is “falling behind.” And where exactly does this race lead? What is waiting at the finish line? It’s a sad race to nowhere.

Mathematics is about problems

> Mathematics is about problems, and problems must be made the focus of a students mathematical life. Painful and creatively frustrating as it may be, students and their teachers should at all times be engaged in the process— **having ideas, not having ideas, discovering patterns, making conjectures, constructing examples and counterexamples, devising arguments, and critiquing each other’s work**.

Poor teachers

> No, I blame the culture that produces them. The poor devils are trying their best, and are **only doing what they’ve been trained to do**. I’m sure most of them love their students and hate what they are being forced to put them through. They know in their hearts that it is meaningless and degrading. They can sense that they have been made **cogs in a great soul-crushing machine**, but they lack the perspective needed to understand it, or to fight against it. They only know they **have to get the students “ready for next year.”**

Art of the proof

> The problem with the standard geometry curriculum is that the **private, personal experience of being a struggling artist** has virtually been eliminated. The art of proof has been **replaced by a rigid step-by step pattern of uninspired formal deductions**. The textbook presents a set of definitions, theorems, and proofs, the teacher copies them onto the blackboard, and the students copy them into their notebooks. They are then asked to mimic them in the exercises. Those that **catch on to the pattern quickly are the “good” students**.

Start with the problems

> The point is you don’t start with definitions, you start with problems. Nobody ever had an idea of a number being “irrational” until Pythagoras **attempted to measure the diagonal of a square and discovered that it could not be represented as a fraction**. Definitions make sense when a point is reached in your argument which makes the distinction necessary. To make definitions without motivation is more likely to cause confusion.

Education guarantee?

> SIMPLICIO: But then how can schools guarantee that their students will all have the same basic knowledge? How will we accurately measure their relative worth? SALVIATI: They can’t, and we won’t. Just like in real life. Ultimately you have to face the fact that **people are all different, and that’s just fine**. In any case, there’s no urgency.
