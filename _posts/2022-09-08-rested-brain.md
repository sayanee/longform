> respite is an essential component of both productivity and creativity

Periods of intensity and rest

> What I found is a community of people including scientists and artists and authors who follow this **pattern of working very intensively a few hours a day and then resting deliberately in various ways**.

Not working has become a cultural norm for laziness

> We have **adopted industrial-age attitudes**, and they don't really work for us. There is also a long-standing assumption that **not working hard is morally suspect**.

Taking refreshing breask like walks can help with problem solving

> When you do things like **go for a long walk, your subconscious mind keeps working on problems**. The experience of having the mind slightly relaxed allows it to explore different combinations of ideas, to test out different solutions. And then **once it has arrived at one that looks promising, that is what pops into your head as an Aha! moment**. The people I looked at are able to construct daily schedules that allow them to draw on that process in little increments.

Rest is not passive. Rest is not an optional leftover activity.

> I thought about rest as much more passive and as something you do when you're finished with everything else you have going on. I now firmly believe that is wrong. **Rest is not this optional leftover activity. Work and rest are actually partners.**

Take moments of waiting to let your mind wander

> I am a lot more conscious now when I am in line at the bank or have a couple free minutes; rather than pulling up my phone and checking e-mail, I will let my mind wander. I think it's a good discipline and I think I have become better at crafting those moments that invite insight. And I carry around a little notebook and pen all the time now
