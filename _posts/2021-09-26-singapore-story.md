## What Singapore does well

System-based

> How did we differentiate ourselves from them? They are not clean systems; we run **clean systems**. Their rule of law is wonky; we **stick to the law**. Once we come to an agreement or make a decision, we stick to it. We become **reliable and credible to investors**.

To the top or decline

> The choice is simple. Either we have a **first-class airline, a first-class shipping line, and a first-class bank**, or we decline. One of the things we did in the early years was to buck the third world trend by inviting the multinational corporations, and we succeeded.

Acid test of a system

> The acid test of any legal system is *not the greatness or the grandeur of its ideal concepts*, but whether, in fact, it is able to **produce order and justice in the relationships between person and person, and between person and the state**.”


Singaporean citizens should cultivate three qualities:

1. A striving, acquisitive community.
2. We want forward-looking good management.
3. Easy social mobility.

Singapore's competitive advantage of the government

> Lee saw a **clean, efficient, rational and predictable government** as a competitive advantage. He sought order and justice in the **relationships between citizens and the state**.

Lee’s top three priorities were cultivating

(1) a determined leadership
(2) an efficient administration
(3) social discipline

Import - export rethinking

> Singapore embraced global markets and sought multinational companies to spur industrial growth and **shifted away from import substitution, towards export-led industrialization**, a decision at odds with the conventional wisdom of the time.

## Challenges of Singapore

Equatorial climate

> There is only one other civilization near the equator that ever produced anything worthy of its name. That was in the Yucatan Peninsula – the Mayan Civilization There is no other place where human beings were able to surmount the problems of a soporific equatorial climate.

Lack of natural resources

> However, Singapore’s lack of resources proved to be a blessing in disguise. Its reliance on the outside world **forced the country to think in terms of a global network**. To survive, it had to focus on being a valuable, stable trade partner.

## What America does well

American system based on individual

> In American culture, an individual’s interest is primary. This makes American society more aggressively competitive, with a sharper edge and higher performance.”

4 features of American entrepreneurship

> “These are the four salient features of America’s entrepreneurial culture: (1) a national emphasis on **personal independence and self-reliance**, (2) respect for those starting **new businesses**, (3) **acceptance of failure** in entrepreneurial and innovation efforts, and (4) **tolerance for a high degree of income disparity**.”

Advantages of America

> In fact, American society was so successful for so long not because of these ideas and principles, but because of a **certain geopolitical good fortune**, an **abundance of resources and immigrant energy**, a generous flow of capital and technology from Europe, and **two wide oceans** that kept conflicts of the world away from American shores.”

## Challenges of America

Cons of extreme individualism

> The expansion of the right of the individual to behave or misbehave as he or she pleases has come at the expense of orderly society…It has a lot to do with the **erosion of the moral underpinnings** of a society and the diminution

Political system of America based on popularism

> The problem with **popular democracy** is it **incentivizes a short-term mentality**. In search of re-election, **leaders avoid essential discussions** and topics that may divide the voting populous.

Best marketers get elected

> Lee believes that popular democracy, especially in today’s media environment, leads to problems. For example, the **best marketers — not the best governors — get elected**.

Presidential vs partiamentary system

> In the presidential system, your personal appearance on TV is decisive, whereas in a parliamentary system, the prime minister, before he becomes the prime minister, has been a member of parliament, and probably a minister, and in Britain the people have sized you up over a period of time…and they have come to certain conclusions as to what kind of a person you are, what kind of depth you have, what kind of sincerity you have in what you say…

## Summary in the differences

Individual vs masses

> Americans believe in the primary rights of the individual while Singaporeans prioritize the interests of the masses over the interests of the individual.
