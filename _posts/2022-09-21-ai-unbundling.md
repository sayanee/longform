Newspaper don't provide the news, but the distribution of the news

> Newspapers liked to think that they made money because people relied on them for news, furnished by their fearless reporters and hard-working editors;... The Internet revealed the fatal flaw in this worldview: what **newspapers provided was distribution** thanks to infrastructure like printing presses and yours truly.

Internet reduced that distribution cost to zero

> Once the Internet reduced distribution costs to zero, three truths emerged: first, that **“news”, once published, retained no economic value**. Second, **newspapers no longer had geographic monopolies**, but were instead in competition with every publication across the globe. Third, **advertisers didn’t care about content**, but rather about reaching customers.

In the earliest of times

> Before humans could write, information could only be conveyed orally; that meant that the creation, vocalization, delivery, and consumption of an idea were all one-and-the-same.

How till AI help with news / content?

> These AI tools will have a similar effect on highly differentiated creators, who will leverage text-based iteration to make themselves more productive and original than ever before.

User-generated to AI-generated

> TikTok, which pulls content from across its network to keep users hooked, is the apotheosis of **user-generated content**; Metaverses may be the apotheosis of **AI-generated content**.

Lower barrier to entry for a new publication

> The shift from paper to digital meant publications could now reach every person on earth (not just their geographic area), and starting a new publication was vastly easier and cheaper than before.

The changed relationships

> The result is that **ad networks don’t really care about the readers** — ... and on the flip-side **publishers don’t really care about the advertisers**

New business model is required

> instead of focusing on journalism and getting the business model for free, publishers need to start with a sustainable business model and focus on journalism that works hand-in-hand with the business model they have chosen.

Niche vs Scale businesses

> are they a niche or scale business? Niche businesses make money by maximizing revenue per user on a (relatively) small user base, Scale businesses make money by maximizing the number of users they reach
