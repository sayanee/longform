- Stallions

Ponies

> Ponies are less sizeable and likely to get done not in coming weeks but perhaps in **coming months up to a year**.

Stallions

> Stallions are **great but large effort** and may or may not get done but in the category of things we would like to be able to do.

Impact vs Difficulty Quadrant

> The grid has two axis. One is for impact the other for difficulty. At this point we aim to lay out every idea that we’ve already written down into a quadrant.

How to choose?

> In general we try to have more work than we can tackle to ensure we’re constrained in a good form and not wasting idle time of people. Ensuring we’re **selective about the things we’re working on and that we’re working on the right things works for us**.
