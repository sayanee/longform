> "The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it." -  Late Mark Weiser, who was the chief scientist at Xerox PARC.

Digital home that senses for useful actions

> Imagine a digital home that **proactively but sensibly supports people** in their daily lives and provides the needed care for the elderly through human centric technology.

Ambient intelligence (AmI)

> Ambient intelligence (AmI) represents the future vision of intelligent computing where explicit input and output devices will not be required; instead **sensors and processors will be embedded into everyday devices** and the environment will adapt to the user’s needs and desires seamlessly.

AmI and AI

> AmI systems, will use the **contextual information gathered** through these embedded sensors and apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to **interpret and anticipate the users’ needs**. The technology will be designed to be human centric and easy to use.

Tailored to user preference

> AmI is intelligent, pervasive, and intuitive. It does not ask the user but **understands the user context**. It does not make its presence felt but takes action that is **tailored to the user’s preference**.

Many technologies at play

> AmI is multi-disciplinary and works at the intersection of several technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), Pervasive-Ubiquitous Computing, Networks and Human Computer Interaction (HCI).

Action and response

> It then decides the next best action and responds back to the user through an intuitively designed natural interface of a smart device.

Challenges with privacy and security

> Questions on data usage, privacy and overall security need to be answered more extensively and the systems designed with trust as a foundational layer.
