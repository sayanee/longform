Monetizing Duolingo

> Of course, to survive, Duolingo had to make money in some place. They chose to do this based on **ads, monthly subscriptions that remove the ads, in-app purchases and the Duolingo English Test**.

75% are working on product

> More than 3/4 of Duolingo’s team works on **engineering, design, product or research**.

Types of organization

> It’s the classic battle: product organization v.s. marketing-sales organization.

5 notable experiments and the concrete impact they had:

1. **Delayed signup**: The Duolingo team found that by allowing users to sign up later and experience some Duolingo lessons first, it could boost the amount of daily active users by 20% .
1. **Streak**: Another important product aspect the Duolingo team experimented with a lot, is the concept of the “streak”, which it borrowed from the gaming industry.
1. **Notifications**: On top of that, the team was able to improve conversions over notifications by around 5% just by changing the copy and by testing different timings
1. **Badges** A classic gamification aspect the Duolingo team added is badges.

Are experiments worth it?

> To prioritize , they have 2 simple cost-benefit prioritization rules: What’s the potential impact of the experiment? The Duolingo team even decided that **experiments with an impact of below 1% are not worth it**. How long will it take to run the experiments?
