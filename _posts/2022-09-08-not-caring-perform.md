Trap

> That trap is to care too much about achieving an outcome.

Clearn intention + practice + not focussed on the outcome

> Contrast this to the other way I learned to catch a ball, which was to (i) have a **clear intention** that I wanted to catch the ball, (ii) **not care if I did or didn’t**, (iii) watch as my hand **reached out perfectly accurately and effortlessly on its own** such that the ball just landed in it.

2 Selves described in Inner Game series of books by W. Timothy Gallwey

- Self 1: the **explicit**, thinking part that tries to catch the ball
- Self 2: the **implicit**, non-thinking part that actually catches the ball

Self 1 can interfere with Self 2

> The **more Self 1 cares about achieving a goal, the more it interferes with the natural functioning of Self 2.** This is why, counterintuitively, the less you care about something, the more easily, effortlessly and effectively it can be achieved.

Not caring vs not intending

> Caring is as described above, and **comes with a sense of the outcome being important**, that it (or we) would bad if the outcome weren’t achieved. There is a physical tension associated with it. **Intending is the activation energy required to take a specific action.** I can intend to catch the ball (or not) as it flies towards me, while not caring whether or not I actually catch it.

Ideal combination

> In this frame, the ideal combination to **minimise or remove self-interference is to have a strong and unambiguous intention** while caring as little as possible. The worst combination for our performance is to have a weak and ambiguous intention while caring strongly about achieving a particular outcome.

Ease and lightness

> Even in competition, it’s possible to maintain a position of “I want to win, but I don’t mind if I don’t”. That mental posture often brings about a sense of ease and lightness that unlock greater levels of performance that actually make winning more likely.
