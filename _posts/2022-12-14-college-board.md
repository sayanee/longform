> “Never give someone only one chance to be great.” - Mr. David Coleman

How College Board makes profit

> The College Board claims to be a non-profit organization, but it’s hard to take that claim seriously when its exam fees for the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), Advanced Placement test (AP), **services for late registration, score verification services** and a multitude of other related fees are costing families and schools millions of dollars each year.

Increasing number of colleges, SAT and AP classes

> We now know there are over 800 colleges (and counting) that are SAT optional or flexible. We also know that AP classes and tests have doubled over the past ten+ years.

Belief that “more is more”

> We have reached a crescendo of students and families believing that “more is more” when it comes to prepping for the PSAT/SAT tests.

Cost of SAT prep

> There are some SAT prep centers that cost upwards of $1800 per in-person course to online courses that cost up to $1400 per course. One-on-One tutoring can cost up to $200 an hour.

Consequences of more tests

> I believe we have more stressed out and anxious children in our high schools than ever before. This is a big reason why.

Homewors without enjoying them

> One thing I can guarantee this type of course load will provide is **4 hours or more of homework every night** and not enough time for students to take electives they will enjoy.

How schools can help

> If schools had the courageous conversation to **eliminate class ranking, eliminate the weighting of AP classes** and mandate lunch for every student, I believe we will have healthier and happier kids.

Things to consider for college readiness:

1. GPA (grade point average) is a much better predictor of college success
1. Rich and eclectic electives – take risks and explore new opportunities
1. Play a sport – physical growth is just as important as academic growth
1. Join clubs – a great way for students to get their social and emotional needs met
1. Join outside school organizations in the community – fosters empathy
1. Work after school part time – teaches responsibility
