What is changing?

> It’s **no longer about risks to data**, but about risks to life and property. And the title really points out that **there’s physical danger here**, and that things are different than they were just five years ago.

Computers and security everywhere

> Our **cars, our medical devices, our household appliances** are all now computers with things attached to them. Your refrigerator is a computer that keeps things cold, and a microwave oven is a computer that makes things hot. And your car is a computer with four wheels and an engine. **Computers are no longer just a screen we turn on and look at**, and that’s the big change.

Hacks against critical infrastructure

> We know that at least twice, Russian **hackers have turned off power to bits of Ukraine’s grid** as part of a broader military campaign. We know that **nation-state hackers have penetrated systems at some US power companies**. These hacks have been exploratory ones and haven’t caused damage, but we know it’s possible to do so.

Patches, or fixes, for software flaws

> Because computers now affect the world in a direct, physical manner, we can’t afford to wait for fixes.

Markets not rewarding security

> Those standards are there because there’s already strong government regulation in this (aviation) and a few other industries. **In consumer goods, you don’t have that level of safety and security**, and that’s going to have to change. The market right now doesn’t reward secure software at all here.

Government role

> They include flexible standards, rigid rules, and tough liability laws whose penalties are big enough to seriously hurt a company’s earnings.

Regulation or innovation?

> We’re past the point where we need to discuss regulation versus no-regulation for connected things; we have to discuss **smart regulation versus stupid regulation**.
