Origin of the theory

> First outlined in a 2004 graduation speech by Finnish-American photographer Arno Minkkinen , the theory claims, in short, that the secret to a creatively fulfilling career lies in understanding the operations of Helsinki's main bus station

Initially all buses will travel the same route

> "This goes on all your creative life: always showing new work, always being compared to others." What's the answer? "It's simple. **Stay on the bus. Stay on the fucking bus.**"

Much later, the routes will start to diverge

> Helsinki's bus routes diverge, plunging off on idiosyncratic journeys to very different destinations. That's when the photographer finds a **unique "vision"**, or – if you'd rather skip the mystificatory art talk

Initial stages require persistence

> how vividly it illustrates a **critical insight about persistence**: that in the first weeks or years of any worthwhile project, feedback – whether from your own emotions, or from other people – isn't a reliable indication of how you're doing.

Initially, there is no originality

> The second point concerns the **perils of a world that fetishises originality**

Trudge down the pre-trodden path

> yet the Helsinki theory suggests that if you pursue originality too vigorously, you'll never reach it. Sometimes it takes more guts to keep trudging down a pre-trodden path, to the originality beyond.
