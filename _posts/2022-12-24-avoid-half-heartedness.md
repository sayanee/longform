When people are sure-hearted

> I think that **people come alive when they’re serious about what they love** — when they choose to pay careful attention to what feeds and sustains them.

Finding love

> If you want to be loved, find something you love. People can sense it when you have something you’re dedicated to.

Be sure of yourself

> **When you’re unsure of yourself, it’s easy to be obsessed with the idea of love** — the idea that happiness will arrive when someone else loves you. **This can lead to you ignoring your own life.**

When you don't get love

> The difference is that it won’t matter so much, because **you already have something to pour your love into, something that nourishes you**. So you don’t have to spend your time watching everyone else to see if they glance towards you and deign to bestow their love.

Discomfort and uncertainty

> You have so much within you. Pay attention to it. **Pay attention to your feelings of discomfort and uncertainty** — watch yourself as you think and feel.

Choose your art

> Later she encourages Cass to “Choose your art, practice your art, always, **always choose your art over and above anything else.** If you can’t do that, then you have — what, a few more years?”

Love is repetition

> **See how strong you become when you remember that love is just reassertation, choosing something over and over.** Do it one more time & watch mundane repetition become something transcendent.
