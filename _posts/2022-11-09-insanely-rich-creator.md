Research content you like

> Comb through all the videos of people whose success fills you with jealous rage. Take notes on what they’re doing and how they’re doing it. How do they format their content? What’s their lighting and cutting like? What about their thumbnails or hero images? How do they speak? What topics do they focus on? What trends do they jump on?

Track what you created

> Start a spreadsheet where you track everything you create and how well it does in terms of likes and followers, and keep refining around the most successful stuff until you’ve hit your stride.

Foundation for growth

> With 10,000 followers on YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, or Instagram, you have a foundation of initial viewers for any piece of content that increases its potential to go viral.

Feed algorithm

> The Feed wants to see what you’re publishing is doing well before it promotes it to people who didn’t opt-in, so the more initial viewers you have to give it those likes and shares, the more likely it is to take off.

Waiting and patience

- Option One : You can power through, be patient, and recognize that variations in results are normal.
- Option Two : You can pay someone to make you feel better about the wait, usually through coaching or courses.

Creative work is not linear

> The school system and the corporate job ladder brainwashed you into expecting a pleasant, predictable life of advancing to a new grade or earning a 7% raise every year, but the real world is not so linear.

Initial monetization options are typically:

- Ads
- Affiliates
-  Memberships

Valuable audience > Bigger audience

> Instead of getting a bigger audience, attract a more valuable audience. An audience that wants to spend money because they believe that by spending money, they’ll make more money later.
