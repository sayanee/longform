Why transparency is important

> By law, the Department of Defense has to provide Congress and the public with an assessment of where it spends its money and to provide transparency of its operations.

Auditing the DoD

> Auditing the Department of Defense is a massive undertaking. For one thing, it is the country’s largest employer, with 2.9 million people.

What audit does

> The audit has to count the location and condition of every piece of military equipment, property, inventory, and supplies. And there are a lot of them.

Manpower in the audit

> The audit was not a trivial effort, it required 1,600 auditors – 1,450 from public accounting firms and 150 from the Office of Inspector General.

Cost of the audit

> With defense spending on auditing approaching a billion dollars a year, it was clear it would take a decade or more to catch up to the audit standards of private companies.

Audit 5.0 Initiative

> And that we start an initiative for the 5th generation of audit practices ( the Audit 5.0 Initiative ) with machine learning, predictive analytics, Intelligent sampling and predictions.

Spinning off the good parts learned from the Audit 5.0 initiative

> Working together, the defense department could create the next generation of machine-driven and semiautomated standards. Furthermore, it could help the Independent Public Accounting firms (KPMG, EY, PwC, Deloitte, et al) create a new practice and make them partners in the Audit 5.0 initiative.

Advantages of Audit 5.0

> Spinning up these activities up would dramatically reduce the department’s audit costs, standardize its financial management environment, and provide confidence in their budget, auditability, and transparency.
