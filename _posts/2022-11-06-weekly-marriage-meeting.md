Keeping in sync with your partner

> the art of marriage is really the art of **keeping up to date with your partner, of staying on track with your own and each other’s life goals as they emerge, exist, and change**.

Four parts:

- Appreciation (expressing gratitude to your spouse)
- Chores (making sure to-dos are getting done)
- Plan for Good Times (scheduling date nights, as well as individual and family activities)
- Problems/Challenges (addressing conflicts/issues/changes in the relationship and in life in general).

Sit side-by-side

> Sit together. Berger advises against sitting across a table from each other, as that can feel confrontational, and recommends sitting side-by-side instead.

Notes during the week

> Jot down notes during the week. It’s useful to jot down notes in the days leading up to meeting on things you’d like to talk about.

Medium duration

> Keep the meeting to about 20-30 minutes. 20-30 minutes is long enough to cover the four stages of the meeting, but short enough to keep it focused and productive.

Not routine, but occasional chores

> You don’t have to talk about chores for which you’ve already established a routine and division of duties that’s working well. Instead, discuss chores that aren’t getting done and are occasional rather than reoccurring.

One activity just by themselves

> At your weekly marriage meeting, each partner should let the other know of at least one activity they’d like to do by themselves or with a friend.
