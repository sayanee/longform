Definition of dirty work

> The Dirty Work Theory: The lamentable work that many people avoid are great places to look for **high impact, low hanging fruit**.

Reality of hiring at high-growth companies

> Often, the **sexiest high-growth companies are over-hiring** – they don’t truly need you.

Examples of high impact dirty work that people often avoid

- On-call Support of the product
- Administration
- Bookkeeping
- Documentation
- Tech debt
- Secondary products
- QA
- Compliance
- GDPR
- Apologizing to angry customers
- Training your sales team
- Researching the competition
- Writing high-quality documentation
- Answering product questions from internal teams

Fix the system

> One of the absolute best ways to learn about a system and identify opportunities to fix that system is through on-call. Especially if you’re an engineering manager, get into the on-call rotation!

Examples of good QA

> Good QA builds automation, forms sophisticated risk profiles to weight work, and often requires deep understanding of human bias and behavior. And the best QA builds a set of expectations, metrics, and enablement so that an entire team can ship both faster and higher quality
