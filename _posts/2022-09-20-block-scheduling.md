Block scheduling is a superset of Pomodoro method

> Block scheduling is a variant of the time-tested productivity system known as the Pomodoro Method — in which days are split into sprints, or 20-minute chunks of time, with five-minute breaks between tasks

Types of block-scheduling methods

1. Time blocking
1. Task batching
1. Day theming
1. Time boxing

Task batching

> Task batching is less specific and offers a time frame in which to handle specific tasks, like setting aside an hour to answer emails, as Pasricha suggests, or 30 minutes to pay your bills.

Time blocking and time boxing

> Time blocking and time boxing require planning a specific goal, task, or deliverable around a single slot, like choosing to write for four hours each morning or setting aside two hours to finish a draft of a presentation.

Day theming

> Before you start block scheduling, be honest about the way you work so you can decide how to maximize both your productivity and health. Can you work in “day themes” that are **broad in scope and require initiative and advance planning**?
