### Musk and Twitter

Experience of Musk on Twitter

> The problem, though, is that Musk’s Twitter experience — thought to be an asset, including by yours truly — isn’t really relevant to the actual day-to-day reality of the site as experience by Twitter’s actual users.

Mistakes during rapid iteration

> it’s understandable that mistakes will be made; the point of rapid iteration is to learn more quickly, which is to say that Twitter has, for years, not been learning very much at all.

### Sam Bankman-Fried

Saviour mindset with road to hell is paved with good intentions

> There are a few different ways to interpret Sam Bankman-Fried’s political activism: That he believed in the causes he supported sincerely and made a mistake with his business. That he **supported the causes cynically as a way to curry favor and hide his fraud**. That he believed **he was some sort of savior gripped with an ends-justify-the-means mindset** that led him to believe fraud was actually the right course of action.

Should business be about more than business?

> What is interesting is that all of the explanations are an outgrowth of the view that business ought to be about more than business: to simply want to make money is somehow wrong; **business is only good insofar as it is dedicated to furthering goals** that don’t have anything to do with the business in question.

Curren climate on judging entrepreneurs and businesses

> there tends to be cynicism about the idea of changing the world by building a business; **entrepreneurs are judged by whether their intentions beyond business are sufficiently large and politically correct**.

Getting rich with great ambitions

> That, though, is precisely why Bankman-Fried was viewed with such credulousness: he had the “right” ambitions and the “right” politics, so of course he was running the “right” business; he wasn’t one of those “true believers” who simply wanted to get rich off of blockchains.

### Centralization and Decentralization

Pros of centralization

> centralized companies deliver a better user experience, which encompasses everything from UI to security to at least knocking down the value of your stolen assets on your behalf; a better user experience leads to more users, which increases power over supply, further enhancing the user experience, in the virtuous cycle described by Aggregation Theory .

Aggregation Theory applied to Web 3 as well

> That Aggregation Theory applies to Web 3 is not some sort of condemnation of the idea; it is, perhaps, a challenge to the insistence that crypto is something fundamentally different than the web.

Crypto and AI

> Crypto is decentralizing, AI is centralizing, or if you want to frame in a more ideologically, you could say crypto is libertarian, and AI is communist…

AI and centralization

> AI is communist in the sense it’s about big data, it’s about big governments controlling all the data, knowing more about you than you know about yourself,

Crypto and centralization

> crypto in practice and at scale tends towards centralization.

AI and decentralization

> Just as the theory of crypto was decentralization but the product manifestation tended towards centralization, the theory of AI was centralization but a huge amount of the product excitement over the last few months has been decentralized and open source.
