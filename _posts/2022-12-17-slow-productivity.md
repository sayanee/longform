A little every day

> “Since we’re on Rolling Stone , I’ve go to let y’all know, that for everybody that wants to feature: **I only rap three hours a day**

First thing in them orning

> I get in the studio at 6 o’clock and I’m done around 9 o’clock in the morning…I don’t really like rapping too long. It gives me anxiety. I feel energy, I’m in the studio, I knock it done right there

Compounding achievement

> But as June elaborates to the reporter, his technique works because of the miracle of compounding achievement

Too long is exhaustive and performative

> Spending 16 hours in the studio **feels “productive” in an exhausting, performative sense**. Retreating to your basement for only a few hours each morning seems somehow diminished by comparison.

How to measure accomplishment

> accomplishment is often best measured on the scale of years not days, and when you zoom out to this grander level, the advantages of a focused slowness become hard to ignore.
