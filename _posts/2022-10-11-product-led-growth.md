Buying patterns in younger gen buyers

> As millennials and zoomers, buyers today have **deeper experience with technology** than previous generations and **different expectations**.

Less touch points

> the different behaviors they’ve observed from today’s younger buyers. They **don’t require as many touch points** along the buyer journey, and they **want to stay anonymous for as long as possible**.

> Users **expect to try before they buy**, and buyers are less loyal to vendors who aren’t meeting their needs or expectations.

Build products around user behavior

> Younger buyers are **attracted to authenticity** and they notice when a product isn’t providing the experience the sales team promised. Enter product-led growth: authentic products built when organizations function around one heartbeat — the user’s. And **what could be more authentic than a product that sells and markets itself?**
