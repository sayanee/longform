Challenge of today

> Among the great challenges posed to democracy today is the **use of technology, data, and automated systems** in ways that threaten the rights of the American public.

Process must not impeed certain things

> This important progress must not come at the **price of civil rights or democratic values**.

5 principles to guide building AI:

1. Safe and Effective Systems
1. Algorithmic Discrimination Protections
1. Data Privacy
1. Notice and Explanation
1. Human Alternatives, Consideration, and Fallback

Safe and Effective Systems

> Systems should undergo pre-deployment testing, risk identification and mitigation, and ongoing monitoring that demonstrate they are safe and effective based on their intended use, mitigation of unsafe outcomes including those beyond the intended use, and adherence to domain-specific standards.

Algorithmic Discrimination Protections

>  You should not face discrimination by algorithms and systems should be used and designed in an equitable way.

Data Privacy

> Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should **seek your permission and respect your decisions** regarding collection, use, access, transfer, and deletion of your data in appropriate ways and to the greatest extent possible; **Continuous surveillance and monitoring should not be used** in education, work, housing, or in other contexts where the use of such surveillance technologies is likely to limit rights, opportunities, or access

Notice and Explanation

> Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should **provide generally accessible plain language documentation including clear descriptions of the overall system functioning** and the role automation plays, notice that such systems are in use, the individual or organization responsible for the system, and explanations of outcomes that are clear, timely, and accessible

Human Alternatives, Consideration, and Fallback

>  You should be able to opt out, where appropriate, and have access to a person who can quickly consider and remedy problems you encounter
