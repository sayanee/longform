Type of work that Gen Z does not want

> Nobody wants to work in jobs where they are **underpaid, underappreciated, and overworked** — especially not young people

Be aware of stereotypes

> These **age-based categorizations are usually reductive**, and exclude key factors like education level, social class, race, and gender in their analyses. Still, they do offer a revealing read into the ambitions and aspirations of the country’s youngest workers, regardless of whether they’re actively leaving their jobs.

Expectations from employers

> What sets zoomers apart, according to common narratives, is their **determination to be fulfilled and defined by other aspects of life**. They expect employers to recognize that and **promote policies and benefits that encourage work-life balance**

Zoomers are not anti-work

> Carson doesn’t think that most zoomers are actually anti-work, at least from a political perspective. In fact, she said, she thinks it’s the opposite: She has noticed more young people publicly committing to quit an undesirable job so that they can devote more time to learning new skills, in the hopes of entering a field like tech, which boasts high salaries and good benefits.

Work for a lifetime, but not tied to an employer

> Most of us won’t ever stop working, although it is healthy to **detach from an employer-oriented identity**.
