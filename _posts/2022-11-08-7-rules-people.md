Spotlight bias

> **People don’t care about you**. This isn’t because people are mean or hurtful, but simply because they are mostly focused on themselves...  What does this mean? Embarrassment doesn’t make a lot of sense.

Give the benefit of the doubt

> People who appear to be mean or hurtful don’t usually do it intentionally.

Initiate

> Relationships are your job to maintain. Don’t wait to be invited to parties or for people to approach you.

Don’t assume malice

> So don’t get angry when people aren’t responding to you.

Helping you in a win-win:

- Transactions – If I purchase a car, both myself and the dealer benefit.
- Familial – Blood is thicker than water. We are designed to protect people who share our genes.
- Status – Helping someone is a sign of power. Many species of primates will offer assistance as a sign of dominance.
- Implied Reciprocity – Many relationships are based on the idea that if I help you, one day you will help me as well. Occasionally

Don't assume malice or disinterest

> But the fact is most people don’t have organized GTD systems. People are forgetful by nature, so once again, don’t assume malice or disinterest if something is forgotten.
