Aims:

- Improving the cybersecurity of our critical infrastructure.
- Ensuring new infrastructure is smart and secure
- Countering ransomware attacks to protect Americans online.
- Working with allies and partners to deliver a more secure cyberspace
- Building the Nation’s cyber workforce and strengthening cyber education.
- Protecting the future – from online commerce to national secrets — by developing quantum-resistant encryption.

Sectors

> The Administration has worked closely with key sectors – including transportation, banking, water, and healthcare – to help stakeholders understand cyber threats to critical systems and adopt minimum cybersecurity standards.

Financial blockings

> The United States has made it harder for criminals to move illicit money, sanction a series of cryptocurrency mixers used regularly by ransomware actors to collect and “clean” their illicit earnings.

Developing a new label to help Americans know their devices are secure.

> a label for Internet of Things (IoT) devices so that Americans can easily recognize which **devices meet the highest cybersecurity standards** to protect against hacking and other cyber vulnerabilities.

Starting with routers and home cameras

> We are starting with some of the most common, and often most at-risk, technologies — routers and home cameras — to deliver the most impact, most quickly.

Quantum encryption

> Advancements in quantum computing threaten that encryption, so this summer the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced four new encryption algorithms that will become part of NIST’s post-quantum cryptographic standard, expected to be finalized in about two years.
