Case study profile

> This 100+-year-old company has seven major product divisions, each with hundreds of products.

Questions to ask:

- How do they embrace new technologies?
- How do they convert existing manufacturing plants (and their workforce) for a completely new set of technologies?
- How do they bring on new supply chains?
- How do they become present on new social media and communications channels?
- How do they connect with a new generation of customers who had no brand loyalty?

Wrong assumptions

> I understood some **requirements were known and immutable**. However, when all of the requirements are handed to the action teams this way the assumption is that the **problems have been validated**, and the teams do not need to do any further exploration of the problem space themselves.

The different parties involved

> Deeply understand the problems – who are the customers, internal stakeholders and beneficiaries

The correct approach

> when team members **get out of their buildings and comfort zones, and directly talk to, observe, and interact with the customers, stakeholders and beneficiaries**, it allows them to be agile, and the solutions they deliver will be needed, timely, relevant and take less time and resources to develop. It’s the **difference between admiring a problem and solving one**.

Terrain walk

> A terrain walk often discovers that the problem is actually a symptom of another problem or that the sources see it as a different version of the problem.
