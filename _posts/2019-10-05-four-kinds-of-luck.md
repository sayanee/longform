4 kinds of chances:

1. **Chance I** is completely impersonal; you can't influence it.
1. **Chance II** favors those who have a persistent curiosity about many things coupled with an energetic willingness to experiment and explore.
1. **Chance III** favors those who have a sufficient background of sound knowledge plus special abilities in observing, remembering, recalling, and quickly forming significant new associations.
1. **Chance IV** favors those with distinctive, if not eccentric hobbies, personal lifestyles, and motor behaviors.

4 questions:

1. How energetic are we?
1. How curious are we?
1. How flexible and aggressive are we at synthesizing?
1. How uniquely are we developing a personal point of view? A personal approach?

Chance II

> A certain [basic] level of action "stirs up the pot", **brings in random ideas that will collide and stick together in fresh combinations, lets chance operate**. Motion yields a network of new experiences which, like a sieve, filter best when in constant up- and-down, side-to-side movement.

Chance III

> Chance III involves involves a **special receptivity, discernment, and intuitive grasp of significance unique to one particular recipient**. Louis Pasteur characterized it for all time when he said, "Chance favors the prepared mind."

Chance IV

> Chance IV is the kind of luck that develops during a probing action which has a distinctive personal flavor. The English Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, summed up the principle underlying Chance IV when he noted: "We make our fortunes and we call them fate." Chance IV comes to you, unsought, because of who you are and how you behave.
