### Reggio Emilia

General idea

> The approach supports **learning through play, discovery, interdependence and socio-cultural learning**. This is achieved through a balance of **self-guided and peer or adult-led learning**.

The key principles of the approach are:

- Collaborative, self-guided learning
- A project-based approach
- Interactions and relationships
- Age groups

Both adult and child-led

> The direction of education is **guided though both adult and child-led learning**. Teachers play multiple roles and are responsive to the context and needs of the learner.

Hands-on discovery

> Hands on discovery is a hugely important part of the Reggio Emilia approach. This is symbolised by the ‘100 languages of children‘ – a metaphor that describes the infinite number of ways that children can express themselves.

Classroom

> The focus is on pleasing aesthetics, a welcoming and warm atmosphere, learning being made visible through **displays of the children’s artwork and projects, and is light and airy**. Each child has easy access to all learning materials.

### Montessori

The key principles of Montessori education are as follows:

- Self-guided learning
- Uninterrupted work time
- Focuses on the child as a whole
- Learning tools
- Mixed age spanning 3 years

Role of the teacher

> Montessori teachers play an unobtrusive role – one that sees them directing the education of their students without excessive interference.

Classroom

> Montessori classrooms are more structured, with areas dedicated to specific activities.

### Differences and similarities

Curriculim differences: emergent vs structured

> One of the key differences is that the Reggio Emilia approach has an emergent curriculum, whereas Montessori is more structured. The former is a kindergarten (pre-prep) educational approach, whereas Montessori schools extend from 3 years to adolescent age (12-15).

Philosophy vs curriculum

> The Reggio Emilia approach is a philosophy, not a curriculum and, unlike the Montessori approach, there is no accreditation process for schools to be inspired by.

Classroom

> Montessori classrooms are more structured, with areas dedicated to specific activities. Similar to that of Reggio Emilia classrooms, furniture is scaled to be size appropriate for the age-range. Children use tables or the floor rather than desks.

Origin and education age

> Both are educational approaches that hail from Italy. Both philosophies promote self-guided learning. Reggio Emilia focuses on kindergarten (pre-prep) education, Montessori is also found up to schools of adolescent age (12-15 years).

Teachers

> Reggio Emilia teachers are considered to be co-learners. Montessori teachers act as directors of education.
