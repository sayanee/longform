definitions

> Proof-of-stake and proof-of-work are known as consensus mechanisms . Both, in different ways, help **ensure users are honest with transactions**, through **incentivizing good actors and making it extremely difficult and expensive for bad actors**. This reduces fraud such as double spending.

Proof of Work

> In proof-of-work, verifying cryptocurrency transactions is **done through mining**. In proof of stake, **validators are chosen based on a set of rules** depending on the "stake" they have in the blockchain, meaning how much of that token they commit to locking up to have a chance to be chosen as a validator

Disadvantages of Proof-of-work

> Proof-of-work **requires a significant amount of energy to verify transactions**. Since the computers on the network must spend a lot of energy and operate a lot, the blockchain is less environmentally friendly than other systems.

Disadvantages of proof-of-stake

> The main issue with proof-of-stake is that it requires an often **enormous initial investment**. You **must purchase enough of the native token of that cryptocurrency** to qualify to be a validator.

No system is perfect

> Proof-of-stake and proof-of-work both have pros and cons, and it's important to acknowledge that no system is perfect. Every system has its strengths and weaknesses, and which one you think is better ultimately depends on your point of view.
