The light bulb would have still been invented without Thomas Edison

> Thomas Edison invented the light bulb in 1879. What if he had never been born, Would we still have light bulbs? And would they still have been invented in 1879? It turns out that this is not just a philosophical question and the answer is yes, **the light bulb would have been invented at roughly the same time**

Lone geniuses?

> All this synchronicity reveals something fundamental about the nature of invention. **In popular culture inventors are romanticized as lone geniuses** working in home laboratories who come up with completely new ideas — things that establishment thinkers initially dismiss as nonsense.

Inventions need pre-requisites of that era

> The incremental nature of invention has another fascinating consequence besides simultaneous invention. Since **significant discoveries require a base of knowledge and tools that is outside the scope of any one person to create**, new inventions only happen when “the time is right”.

Adjacent possible areas + supply of enough smart people = invention

> Taken together, all this suggests that inventions are inevitable. Once an idea enters the realm of the adjacent possible the supply of people who are smart enough to act on it is sufficiently large that **the idea will quickly be discovered, often by multiple people**.

Inventions are the end result of process, not individuals

> Inventions are not pioneering feats of individuals, but the necessary results of a social process.
