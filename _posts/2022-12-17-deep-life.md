Handling Social media distractions

> Take Instagram off of your phone; prune down accounts you follow to people you really care about or inspire you. Eliminate negative tweeting. Alcohol only on weekends.

Focus and avoid

> focus with energetic intention on things that really matter, and avoid wasting too much attention on things that don’t.

No master plan, no dramatic moment

> you should resist the urge to try to build a master plan that, once implemented, will transform everything for the better in one dramatic moment. This optimism is quixotic. It’s much **more realistic to experiment with smaller shifts**, one after another, to discover what sticks and what ends up superfluous.

Amplify and reduce habits

> The details here matter less than the general strategy: month after month, relentlessly look to amplify habits that matter while reducing behaviors that don’t.
